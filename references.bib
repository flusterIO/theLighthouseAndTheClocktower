                microwave background using Type Ia supernovae (SNe) measurements.
                We take into account the correlations in the error bars of the
                SNe measurements arising from correlated peculiar velocities.
                Without accounting for correlations in the peculiar velocities,
                the SNe data we use appear to detect the peculiar velocity of the
                Solar system at about the 3.5σ level. However, when the
                correlations are correctly accounted for, the SNe data only
                detect the Solar system peculiar velocity at about the 2.5σ
                level. We forecast that the Solar system peculiar velocity will
                be detected at the 9σ level by GAIA and the 11σ level by the
                Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. For these surveys, we find the
                correlations are much less important as most of the signal comes
                from higher redshifts where the number density of SNe is
                insufficient for the correlations to be important.},

    abstract = {The cosmic dipole measured in surveys of cosmologically distant
                sources is generally found to be in disagreement with the
                kinematic expectation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
                This discrepancy represents severe tension with the Cosmological
                Principle and challenges the standard model of cosmology. Here,
                we present a Bayesian analysis of the tension between data sets
                used to measure the cosmic dipole. We examine the National Radio
                Astronomy Observatory VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP
                (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) Continuum Survey
                (RACS), and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer catalogue
                (CatWISE), and jointly analyse them with the Planck observations
                of the CMB. Under the kinematic interpretation, we find that
                Planck is in severe tension with CatWISE above \$5\\sigma\$,
                strong tension with RACS, and moderate tension with NVSS.
                Moreover, the strong concordance between CatWISE and NVSS
                suggests that their dipoles arise from a common astrophysical
                signal. Conversely, the high discordance between RACS and both
                CatWISE and NVSS indicates a possible systematic difference in
                the RACS catalogue itself. Whilst the tension between Planck and
                infrared-selected quasars is already significant, the question of
                whether or not the dipole in individual radio surveys adds to the
                challenge against the standard model is yet to be seen. We
                estimate that \$\\mathcal \{O\}(10^6)\$ radio sources are
                required to measure the tension to a significance of \$5\\sigma\$
                . Therefore, in light of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array
                radio surveys, we are on the cusp of disentangling the anomaly of
                the cosmic dipole.},
